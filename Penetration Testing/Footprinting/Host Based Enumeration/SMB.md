`Server Message Block` (`SMB`) is a client-server protocol that regulates access to files and entire directories and other network resources such as printers, routers, or interfaces released for the network. Information exchange between different system processes can also be handled based on the SMB protocol

Server Message Block (SMB) works at application layer 

An SMB server can provide arbitrary parts of its local file system as shares. Therefore the hierarchy visible to a client is partially independent of the structure on the server. Access rights are defined by `Access Control Lists` (`ACL`). They can be controlled in a fine-grained manner based on attributes such as `execute`, `read`, and `full access` for individual users or user groups. The ACLs are defined based on the shares and therefore do not correspond to the rights assigned locally on the server.

## Samba

As mentioned earlier, there is an alternative implementation of the SMB server called Samba, which is developed for Unix-based operating systems. Samba implements the Common Internet File System (`CIFS`) network protocol

| **SMB Version** | **Supported**                       | **Features**                                                           |
| --------------- | ----------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| CIFS            | Windows NT 4.0                      | Communication via NetBIOS interface                                    |
| SMB 1.0         | Windows 2000                        | Direct connection via TCP                                              |
| SMB 2.0         | Windows Vista, Windows Server 2008  | Performance upgrades, improved message signing, caching feature        |
| SMB 2.1         | Windows 7, Windows Server 2008 R2   | Locking mechanisms                                                     |
| SMB 3.0         | Windows 8, Windows Server 2012      | Multichannel connections, end-to-end encryption, remote storage access |
| SMB 3.0.2       | Windows 8.1, Windows Server 2012 R2 |                                                                        |
| SMB 3.1.1       | Windows 10, Windows Server 2016     | Integrity checking, AES-128 encryption                                 |
|                 |                                     |                                                                        |


When SMB commands are transmitted over Samba to an older NetBIOS service, connections typically occur over TCP ports `137`, `138`, and `139`.


CIFS operates over TCP port `445` exclusively


#### Default Configuration

SMB

```shell-session
0xscary@htb[/htb]$ cat /etc/samba/smb.conf | grep -v "#\|\;" 

[global]
   workgroup = DEV.INFREIGHT.HTB
   server string = DEVSMB
   log file = /var/log/samba/log.%m
   max log size = 1000
   logging = file
   panic action = /usr/share/samba/panic-action %d

   server role = standalone server
   obey pam restrictions = yes
   unix password sync = yes

   passwd program = /usr/bin/passwd %u
   passwd chat = *Enter\snew\s*\spassword:* %n\n *Retype\snew\s*\spassword:* %n\n *password\supdated\ssuccessfully* .

   pam password change = yes
   map to guest = bad user
   usershare allow guests = yes

[printers]
   comment = All Printers
   browseable = no
   path = /var/spool/samba
   printable = yes
   guest ok = no
   read only = yes
   create mask = 0700

[print$]
   comment = Printer Drivers
   path = /var/lib/samba/printers
   browseable = yes
   read only = yes
   guest ok = no
```

We see global settings and two shares that are intended for printers. The global settings are the configuration of the available SMB server that is used for all shares. In the individual shares, however, the global settings can be overwritten, which can be configured with high probability even incorrectly. Let us look at some of the settings to understand how the shares are configured in Samba.

|**Setting**|**Description**|
|---|---|
|`[sharename]`|The name of the network share.|
|`workgroup = WORKGROUP/DOMAIN`|Workgroup that will appear when clients query.|
|`path = /path/here/`|The directory to which user is to be given access.|
|`server string = STRING`|The string that will show up when a connection is initiated.|
|`unix password sync = yes`|Synchronize the UNIX password with the SMB password?|
|`usershare allow guests = yes`|Allow non-authenticated users to access defined share?|
|`map to guest = bad user`|What to do when a user login request doesn't match a valid UNIX user?|
|`browseable = yes`|Should this share be shown in the list of available shares?|
|`guest ok = yes`|Allow connecting to the service without using a password?|
|`read only = yes`|Allow users to read files only?|
|`create mask = 0700`|What permissions need to be set for newly created files?|

## Dangerous Settings

Some of the above settings already bring some sensitive options. However, suppose we question the settings listed below and ask ourselves what the employees could gain from them, as well as attackers. In that case, we will see what advantages and disadvantages the settings bring with them. Let us take the setting `browseable = yes` as an example. If we as administrators adopt this setting, the company's employees will have the comfort of being able to look at the individual folders with the contents. Many folders are eventually used for better organization and structure. If the employee can browse through the shares, the attacker will also be able to do so after successful access.

| **Setting**                 | **Description**                                                     |
| --------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `browseable = yes`          | Allow listing available shares in the current share?                |
| `read only = no`            | Forbid the creation and modification of files?                      |
| `writable = yes`            | Allow users to create and modify files?                             |
| `guest ok = yes`            | Allow connecting to the service without using a password?           |
| `enable privileges = yes`   | Honor privileges assigned to specific SID?                          |
| `create mask = 0777`        | What permissions must be assigned to the newly created files?       |
| `directory mask = 0777`     | What permissions must be assigned to the newly created directories? |
| `logon script = script.sh`  | What script needs to be executed on the user's login?               |
| `magic script = script.sh`  | Which script should be executed when the script gets closed?        |
| `magic output = script.out` | Where the output of the magic script needs to be stored?            |

#### SMBclient - Connecting to the Share

SMB

```shell-session
0xscary@htb[/htb]$ smbclient -N -L //10.129.14.128
```

```shell-session
0xscary@htb[/htb]$ smbclient //10.129.14.128/notes
```

#### Download Files from SMB

SMB

```shell-session
smb: \> get prep-prod.txt 
```

```shell-session
smb: \> !ls

prep-prod.txt


smb: \> !cat prep-prod.txt
```

(`!<cmd>`)

#### Samba Status

SMB

```shell-session
root@samba:~# smbstatus
```

#### RPCclient

SMB

```shell-session
0xscary@htb[/htb]$ rpcclient -U "" 10.129.14.128
```

|**Query**|**Description**|
|---|---|
|`srvinfo`|Server information.|
|`enumdomains`|Enumerate all domains that are deployed in the network.|
|`querydominfo`|Provides domain, server, and user information of deployed domains.|
|`netshareenumall`|Enumerates all available shares.|
|`netsharegetinfo <share>`|Provides information about a specific share.|
|`enumdomusers`|Enumerates all domain users.|
|`queryuser <RID>`|Provides information about a specific user.|
it can also happen that not all commands are available to us, and we have certain restrictions based on the user. However, the query `queryuser <RID>` is mostly allowed based on the RID. So we can use the rpcclient to brute force the RIDs to get information. Because we may not know who has been assigned which RID,

#### Brute Forcing User RIDs

SMB

```shell-session
0xscary@htb[/htb]$ for i in $(seq 500 1100);do rpcclient -N -U "" 10.129.14.128 -c "queryuser 0x$(printf '%x\n' $i)" | grep "User Name\|user_rid\|group_rid" && echo "";done
```
